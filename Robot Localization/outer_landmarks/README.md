# Robot-Localization-with-landmarks-outside-the-field
For this task, we will use [`ROS`](https://www.ros.org/) and `Python3` to execute the robot localization task.

## Dependencies
### System
The system dependency preparation depends on your local system. Basically, you need to install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) to be able to run this. We recommend `Ubuntu 20.04`.
* Linux (Ubuntu)
  * There is no preparation needed. Continue to install ROS :)
* Windows
  * You can set up a dual-boot system with Ubuntu.
  * You can use `Windows Subsystem for Linux` to install Ubuntu. You can check instructions on the [official website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or the [recitation](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/499091/files/folder/winter-2022/recitation/Jingyu/Recitation%205%20ROS).
  * You can use virtual machine to install Ubuntu. The [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is free.
* Mac
  * You can use `Bootcamp` to install set dual-boot system with Ubuntu.
  * You can use virtual machine to install Ubuntu. The [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is free. The [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/pd/general/?gclid=CjwKCAiAgbiQBhAHEiwAuQ6Bkqlt6f3diFGjX7eq3WRUtmwu2i4mzV-EWt_CJ9JVDx5AJtAsX0T13BoCA_gQAvD_BwE) is also good.

### ROS
You also need to install ROS (Robot Operating System) after installing Ubuntu. `ROS Noetic` is matched with the recommended `Ubuntu 20.04`. You can find the detailed installation instructions on [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).

### Python Packages
These packages are required. You can install them by typing `pip install $package name$`.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
* [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
* [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

## Test Your Setup
There's a dummy filter which you can run to test if you have set up your environment correctly.
1. Open a terminal, run ```roscore```.
2. Check `config/settings.yaml`, ensure the `filter_name` is set to `test`.
3. Open a new terminal, run ```rviz```.
4. Open a visualization config file. In your rviz, click `file` -> `open config`, choose `rviz/default.rviz` in the folder.
5. Open a new terminal, run ```python3 run.py```.
6. You should be able to see your a robot moving in `rviz`.
<!-- 
**Note:** We include a dummy filter in the code, which allows you to test if you have set up your environment correctly. To run the dummy filter, set `filter_name` to `test` in `config/settings.yaml` and do `python3 run.py`. -->
You should expect to see the visualization shown below. In this figure, `green path` represents command path without action noise, which is the path we want our robot to follow. `blue path` represents the exact path that the robot moves due to action noise. The 'pink path' is the filter corrected path, which is the best estimate of where the robot actually is. The `red ellipse` and the `red arrow` represent the filter prediction pose for the robot.

### Configurations
Parameters can be modified in `config/settings.yaml`.

**You will only need to modify** `filter_name` **and** `Lie2Cart`.

* `filter_name`: The filter you would like to run. Options include: `EKF`,`UKF`, `PF`, `InEKF`, and `test`.
* `Lie2Cart`: Set to `True` if you want to visualize the covariance for 'InEKF'.

<!-- ## Visualization
To visualize the results in rviz, please follow the below steps:

1. In one terminal, open rviz.
2. In rviz, click `file` -> `open config`.
3. Choose `rviz/default.rviz` in the homework folder.
4. Open a new terminal, run your filter. You should be able to see a visualization of the filter. -->
